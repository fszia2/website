<h1> Animal Kingdom</h1>

<p> The animal kingdom is a diverse group of living organisms that includes more than two million species, ranging from tiny single-celled organisms to the largest creatures that have ever lived. Animals are defined as eukaryotic organisms that are multicellular, heterotrophic, and lack cell walls. They are characterized by their ability to move, sense their environment, and respond to stimuli.
Animals are classified into several different groups, including vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone, while invertebrates are animals that do not. Some common examples of vertebrates include mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Invertebrates, on the other hand, include insects, spiders, crustaceans, mollusks, and many other groups of animals.
The animal kingdom is incredibly diverse and complex, with a wide range of adaptations and behaviors that have allowed animals to thrive in nearly every environment on Earth. From the depths of the ocean to the highest mountain peaks, animals have evolved to survive and thrive in some of the most extreme conditions imaginable</p>
